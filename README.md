# Data Structure And Algorithms Demo:

The demo for data structure and algorithms toolkit provide the performance and implementation of each of the data structure and
algorithms that is exists like lists, string, or others structures or algorithms.

## Data structures or algorithms implemented:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Recursive algorithms
- Array sorting algorithms
- Array search algorithms

- Binary Search Trees
- AVL Trees
- Heaps or Priority queues
- Hash Tables
- Associative Containers
- Linked List
- Graphs
- Sets
